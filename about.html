          A stress management guide with practical skills to help cope with stress during COVID-19.
          The government should not use Aadhaar (identity card)-based biometric authentication for the distribution of free
          food grains to the poor, Human Rights Watch said. Even in normal circumstances, failure of Aadhar has led to
          denial of essential services and benefits. In Delhi, Muslims displaced by the communal violence in February
